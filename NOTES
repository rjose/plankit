Let's start by creating all of the files that I've identified. Then, I want to
create some structures so I can create the globals. I'll add these to the
Makefile and get everything to build.

I should use flex to parse numbers and strings. We can return a character to
indicate what type was returned.


>> Sat Feb 11 19:40:59 PST 2017
OK, let's create empty versions of all the files...Done!


>> Sat Feb 11 19:46:04 PST 2017
OK, let's create a get_word routine. I think we should leverage the lexer here
and include the type info as well as the word.


>> Sat Feb 11 19:59:04 PST 2017
OK, I have the get_token subroutine working. Let's distinguish between an int,
a double, and a word. After that, I think we should handle the search for a
word in the dictionary. Maybe we can do the search tomorrow.
